# Agentic-AI-Production-Codes
# 🤖 Agentic-AI-Production-Codes

This repository contains a comprehensive collection of **Agentic AI System Projects** demonstrating the design, implementation, and deployment of intelligent, autonomous AI agents. Each task explores a different capability — from structured output generation to information retrieval, web-based search agents, and domain-specific applications such as AI-powered appointment systems.

---

## 🧠 Overview

The **Agentic-AI-Production-Codes** repository is part of a larger initiative to explore **autonomous agent frameworks** — AI systems capable of reasoning, searching, and interacting with external environments dynamically.

Each task folder (Task 1–5) represents a standalone AI project or capability module developed as part of the **Agentic AI pipeline**.

These tasks collectively aim to:
- Develop **end-to-end intelligent agents** for different use-cases.
- Showcase practical **AI integrations with external tools and APIs**.
- Demonstrate how AI systems can move from **prompt-based outputs** to **goal-oriented autonomous behavior**.

## 📂 Repository Structure

| Folder             | Description |
|--------------------|--------------|
| **`TASK_1-2/`**    | Includes code for foundational AI agents that demonstrate **structured** and **unstructured output generation** using LLMs. |
| **`TASK_3/`**      | Contains implementation of a **Web Search Agent** that integrates with external APIs or search systems to fetch, summarize, and return real-time information. |
| **`TASK_4/`**      | Focused on **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** systems — combining vector databases and LLMs to provide grounded, source-backed answers. |
| **`Task 5/`**      | Includes the **Doctor Appointment AI (MediSathi)** system — an intelligent agent for scheduling and managing virtual/physical doctor appointments. |
| **`README.md`**    | This file — provides full repository overview and usage details. |

## 🧩 Project Summaries

### 🧮 **Task 1 & 2: Structured vs Unstructured Output Agents**
- Implements agents capable of generating both structured JSON-like responses and natural text summaries.
- Demonstrates how prompt engineering affects LLM behavior.
- Ideal for tasks like report generation, knowledge extraction, and entity recognition.

### 🌐 **Task 3: Web Search Agent**
- Integrates a **web scraping / search pipeline**.
- Fetches live information from the web and summarizes it using NLP models.
- Can use **free LLMs** (like Hugging Face or Cohere) and real-time search APIs.

### 📚 **Task 4: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**
- Demonstrates **document retrieval + AI reasoning**.
- Uses embedding-based search to find relevant context before generating responses.
- Applications: chatbots, document assistants, and AI research tools.

### 🩺 **Task 5: Doctor Appointment AI (MediSathi)**
- Domain-specific intelligent system for healthcare scheduling.
- Allows users to **book physical or virtual appointments** with doctors.
- Built using **free and open-source tools**, possibly with Python + Streamlit or Flask backend.
- Integrates conversational AI for natural interaction with patients.
